              <p style="overflow:auto; font-size:20px; text-align:justify"><br>
                Just over a few months ago, we envisioned a world where students and faculty can seamlessly share and distribute books amongst each other without
                the need to go to a Third party service. The reason for this is since Third party sites usually charge an upfront fee for transportation and/or
                services, it devalues the students, our beloved customers, from exchanging any books in the near future. In this day and age, you might believe
                that such a service exists which connects college students, whether transfers or incoming freshman, to exchange books freely. Well that isn’t the
                case at all, until BeachBooks came along!<br><br>

                BeachBooks was founded with the promise to ease the stressfulness of having to buy/sell books throughout your college career. Selling them back to
                the school awards you less than ¼ of what you bought it for and buying books from the university can cost you from $100 to $500 a piece. Wouldn’t
                it be simpler just to exchange the books that you don’t need anymore for books you really need this semester? Well BeachBooks allows you to do just
                that! Just by creating an account with us, you can browse through the selection of hundreds and hundreds of books available online. With just a few
                clicks away, you can be exchanging your books with trusted students around campus without having to haggle with Third party sites. So what are you
                waiting for? Go out there and exchanged those books today at <a href="index.php">BeachBooks.me!</a><br>
